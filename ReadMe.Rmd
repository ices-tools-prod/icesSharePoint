icesSharePoint
=======

icesSharePoint provides helper functions to access the SharePoint site
used by [ICES](http://www.ices.dk/Pages/default.aspx).

<!-- icesSharePoint is implemented as an [R](https://www.r-project.org) package and
available on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=icesSharePoint). -->

Before you can access the SharePoint via R, you must have a valid user name and password
given to you by the ICES Secretariate.  icesSharePoint requires your ICES username and password
to be saved in environment variables, see for example, Appendix: Storing API Authentication Keys/Tokens in the [httr package vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/httr/vignettes/api-packages.html).  The first time you use the API, the package will create an appropriate file ('~/.Renviron_SP') to contain your username and password.  It is important that this file is in a private location in your computer, such as your home drive '~'. Your password is never sent to the API, but is used to authenticate via [ntlm](http://davenport.sourceforge.net/ntlm.html).


Installation
------------

icesSharePoint can be installed from GitHub using the `install_github` command from the
`devtools` package:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(devtools)
install_github("ices-tools-prod/icesSharePoint")
```

Usage
-----

For a summary of the package:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(icesSharePoint)
?icesSharePoint
```


Basic example
-------

First of all you need to set your ices username for the session, this is done like so:
```r
# set ices username
options(icesSharePoint.username = <your ices login name>)
# check it has worked
options("icesSharePoint.username")
```


A first call to anything will ask you for a password, for example:

```r
spdir()
```

there after it will be stored in a secrets store that only you have access to. However be carefull
because if someone gains access to your computer your password will be accessible via:

```r
keyring::key_get("icesSharePoint", "colin") # beware!! this will print your password to the screen
```

You need to be logged into your machine as you to read this, but if someone somehow wrote a dodgy
script, they could programatically access your password.... so beware!

You can clear the password at the end of the session with this:
```r
icesSharePoint:::SP_clearpassword() # which just calls
```

The next step is set the site you are accessing to save supplying it in all
the function calls, this exmaple uses WGMIXFISH-ADVICE sharepoint site. Only ices users who have
been granted access can access this folder.

```r
options(icesSharePoint.site = "/ExpertGroups/WGMIXFISH-ADVICE")
```

Now find the directory you want to access

```r
# this prints the directory contents, and is useful to navigate to find the
# directory or file you are interested in
spdir()
spdir("2020 Meeting Documents")
# etc
spdir("2020 Meeting Documents/06. Data/FIDES")
```

Now that you know the directory you want to acces, you can loop over all the files and
download them one by one.  Single files can also be accessed in a similar way

```r
fnames <- spfiles("2020 Meeting Documents/06. Data/FIDES", full = TRUE)
for (fname in fnames) {
  spgetfile(fname, destdir = ".")
}
```


You can also download the file in one line and specify the site you want to access
from the `spgetfile` function. Another useful point of note is the `destdir` argument.
by default files are downloaded in the same folder structure as they are on the sharepoint,
but destdir overrides this.

```r
spgetfile(
  "2021 Meeting Documents/06. Data/Iberian Waters/ANK2020.xlsx",
  site = "/ExpertGroups/WGMIXFISH-ADVICE",
  destdir = "."
)
```
